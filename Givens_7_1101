The bandwidth of wifi is 802.11n. Wifi has channels 1-11. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are most commonly used because they have the least overlap with the other channels.
"B" supports up to 11Mbps and runs on the 2.4 GHz frequency. "A" supports up to 54Mbps and signals in the frequency spectrum around 5 GHz. "G" supports up to 54Mbps and uses the 2.4 
GHz frequency. "N" uses multiple wireless signals and antennas instead of one. "AC" uses dual-band wireless technology. WEP stands for wired equivalent privacy and it is a security
algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. WPA and WPA2 stand for wifi protected access and wifi protected access II. They are security protocols and security certification
programs. WPA2 is the most secure of these three. Airsnort is a Linux and Microsoft Windows utility for decrypting WEP encryption on an 802.11b network.
