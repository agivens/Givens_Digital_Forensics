1.) Some common cases for digital forensics include computer intrusion,
unauthorized use of corporate computers, child pornography,
and any crime whose suspect had a computer.
2.) The three phases of digital forensic analysis are acquisition,
analysis, presentation.
3.) 
4.)
5.) Inculpatory evidence is evidence that supports a given theory.
6.) Exculpatory evidence is evodence that condradicts a given theory.
7.) Evidence of tampering is veidence that the system was tampered 
with to avoid identification, but doesn't have to necissarily be
related to any theory.
8.) The presentation phase presents the conclusions and evidence
supporting this conclusion. In a legal setting, lawyers must evaluate
the evidence before it's entered.
9.) The four conditions for admissibility of forensic evidence are:
Testing- Can and has the proceedure been tested?
Error Rate- Is there a known error rate of the procedure?
Publication- Has the procedure been published and subject to peer 
review?
Acceptance- Is the procedure generally accepted in the relevant 
scientific community?
10.) A false negative is when a result presents itself as negative
when in reality, the result is positive. A false negative test ensures
that the tool provides all available data from the input.
11.) A false positive is when a result presents itself as positive
when in reality, the result is negative. A false positive test ensures
the tool doesn't introduce new data into the output.
12.) 
13.) The author encourages the use of open source tools in digital 
forensics because digital forensics is a maturing science. The tools
and procedures need to evolve with the science.
